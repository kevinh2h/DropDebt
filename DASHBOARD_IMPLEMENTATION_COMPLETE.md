## üí° Key Innovations

### 1. **Meaningful Progress Display**
```typescript
// NOT: 42.8% completion rate
// YES: "3 of 7 bills current, all utilities secured after next payment"
progressMilestone: {
  description: "3 of 7 bills current",
  nextMilestone: "All utilities current after Friday's payment",
  timelineToStability: "All bills current in 6 weeks"
}
```

### 2. **Financial Status Detection**
```typescript
enum FinancialStatus {
  CRISIS = 'CRISIS',           // Essential needs > income
  URGENT = 'URGENT',           // Critical bills due within days  
  CAUTION = 'CAUTION',         // Tight budget, careful management
  STABLE = 'STABLE',           // Bills manageable, on track
  COMFORTABLE = 'COMFORTABLE'   // Good margin, advancement opportunities
}
```

### 3. **Crisis Alert System**
```typescript
// Emergency resource connections
crisisAlerts: [{
  alertType: 'UTILITY_SHUTOFF',
  description: 'Electric shutoff in 2 days - $320 due',
  immediateAction: 'Call creditor for payment plan',
  emergencyResources: [
    { name: '2-1-1', contactMethod: 'Dial 2-1-1', urgency: 'IMMEDIATE' },
    { name: 'LIHEAP', contactMethod: 'Call 1-866-674-6327' }
  ]
}]
```

### 4. **Next Action Guidance**  
```typescript
// Specific, actionable, with clear consequences
nextAction: {
  action: "Pay Car Payment",
  amount: 289,
  deadline: "2024-01-15T17:00:00Z",
  daysUntil: 3,
  consequence: "Vehicle repossession",
  priority: "HIGH"
}
```
